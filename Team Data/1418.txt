Starting a Low Bar
immediately shoot LG after LB auto
Struggles with moat
Not much pushing power
Climber when extended kinda precarious, scissor lift
Hitched climber late, and thus was not able to climb
5 LG shot

Match 14
LB auto
Immediately goes for LG
Struggles a bit to pick up ball
coops to do group C
easily deals with cheval
Scissor lift extends and snaps on immediately
Easy climb, takes under 10 seconds
Much better showing
3 LG
