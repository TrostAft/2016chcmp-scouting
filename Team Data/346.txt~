This is the team with the lowered bottom and 12 wheels
Lined up with the rock wall at position 3
Easy cross
Lines up for shot, but waits until auto
Shoots from batter, fast and strong shot
Intake is fast, using rock wall for quick transportation
Seems to have stoppped briefly when landing from rock wall, comms issues?
1 missed high goal, not close enough to batter
CLimber extends out of arm and latches easily
Climb easy and under 10 seconds.
