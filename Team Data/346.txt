Summary:
Easy and fast climb, while also scoring 3 HG. Assuming this wasn't a sunny day scenario, this team is better than us. With 3 consistant points, and a 15 pt climb, a auto high goal for us and more consistancy for Vijay will put us on their level. Not better. Do not have group A capability.

This is the team with the lowered bottom and 12 wheels
Lined up with the rock wall at position 3
Easy cross
Lines up for shot, but waits until auto is finished
Shoots from batter, fast and strong shot
Intake is fast, using rock wall for quick transportation
Seems to have stoppped briefly when landing from rock wall, comms issues?
1 missed high goal, not close enough to batter
CLimber extends out of arm and latches easily
Climb easy and under 10 seconds.
3 HG

Quals 40
Lined up in front of ramparts
This 12 wheel design almost works like treads
Seems to be stringling with some defenses
Manages to deal with SP
